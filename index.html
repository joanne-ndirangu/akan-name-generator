            The Akan are the largest ethnic group in Ghana, West Africa. Some Akan also live in neighbouring CÃ´te d'Ivoire (the Ivory Coast). The Akan are divided into many sub-groups, the largest and most famous grouping being the Asante (modern spelling), also spelled Ashanti (older spelling). The second largest group of the Akan are the Fante (modern spelling), also spelled Fanti (older spelling). Other Akan groups include the Akwamu, the Akuapem, the Denkyira, the Nzima and the Baule. Kwame Nkrumah, first president of modern Ghana, was an Nzima. <br>
            The Akan name their children based on the day of the week they are born, with each "day name" having specific meanings related to the soul and character. Middle names often reflect birth order, twin status, or ancestry.
