# Akan Name Generator
A dynamic and interactive we application that follows a specific algorithm to determine a person's Akan name based on their gender and the day of the week they were born. The algorithm typically involves calculating the day of the week based on the user's birthdate and then mapping it to a corresponding Akan name.
